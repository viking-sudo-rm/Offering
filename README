Minecraft server Bukkit mod Offering, made by islendingabok_team aka
viking-sudo-rm.
Feel free to look through the source, and I would love your criticism and
suggestions.
More information about the project is available at bukkit.org.

QUICK DOWNLOAD:
Download the Offering-v1.2.jar file, this is all you need. The rest is just source
for any developers out there. To download it, click it, and then hit the link
"View Raw" that appears.

NOTE:
Ignore the .DS_Store files in some of the directories. These are just there because 
I use Mac and, well, was lazy :D. They mean absolutely nothing.
